Data sets to accompany the code which accompanies the book _[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu)_.  The data sets can be used with any of the implementations (Java, Python, Lisp, etc.) or with your own code.

If used with the code we supply, the data files should be installed in a directory at the same level as the source code.  For example, if you are using the Java code you should have a directory that contains the subdirectories "aima-java" (with the Java code) and "aima-data" (with the files in this project).

You can get the files by unzipping the .zip file in the featured downloads to the right, or by running the "svn checkout" command shown in the "Source" tab above.
